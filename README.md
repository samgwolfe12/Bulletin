# Bulletin

This project is based off of a CSCI 1302 project to create a gallery of album covers using the iTunes API and JavaFX.
I have adapted it to instead, pull pictures from my personal Pinterest board and display them.
20 pictures are displayed at once, and every 2 seconds one picture is replaced with a new one.
Features include:
- A File button to exit the program
- A Theme button which allows the user to apply differnt css stylesheets to the GUI.
- A Info button which provides contact information
- A pause/play button to stop the replacing off pictures
